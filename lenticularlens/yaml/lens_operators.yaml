union:
  label: Union (A ∪ B)
  description: The 'union' is in the Lenticular Lens a set-like operator that unifies
    a collection of sets of links into a single set of all links stemmed from the
    collection. In such a unified set, when dealing with links using symmetric predicates
    such as identity predicates of the likes of owl:sameAs, the duplication of links
    is not allowed. For example, <resource:1 owl:sameAs resource:2> and <resource:2
    owl:sameAs resource:1> are not both admitted in the resulting set. Only one of
    the two is consistently permitted.

difference:
  label: Difference (A ∩ B)
  description: The 'difference' is in the Lenticular Lens a set-like operator between
    two sets A and B of links that results in links stemmed from A that are not in
    B.

sym_difference:
  label: Symmetric difference (A - B)
  description: The 'symmetric difference' is in the Lenticular Lens a set-like operator
    between two sets A and B of links that results in links stemmed from A or B that
    are not in A and B.

intersection:
  label: Intersection (A ∆ B)
  description: The 'intersection' is in the Lenticular Lens a set-like operator between
    two sets A and B of links that results in links that are in both sets A and B.
    In such a result-set, when dealing with links using symmetric predicates such
    as identity predicates of the likes of owl:sameAs, the duplication of links is
    not allowed. For example, <resource:1 owl:sameAs resource:2> and <resource:2 owl:sameAs
    resource:1> are not both admitted in the resulting set. Only one of the two is
    consistently permitted.

in_set_and:
  label: Source and target resources match
  description: The 'source and target resources match' is in the Lenticular Lens a
    set-like operator between two sets A (set of resources) and B (set of links) that
    results in a subset of links from B where only resources from A occur as both
    the subject AND object of each link.

in_set_or:
  label: Source or target resources match
  description: The 'source or target resources match' is in the Lenticular Lens a
    set-like operator between two sets A (set of resources) and B (set of links) that
    results in a subset of links from B where only resources from A occur as the subject
    OR the object of each link.

in_set_source:
  label: Source resources match
  description: The 'source resources match' is in the Lenticular Lens a set-like operator
    between two sets A (set of resources) and B (set of links) that results in a subset
    of links from B where only resources from A occur as the subject of each link.

in_set_target:
  label: Target resources match
  description: The 'target resources match' is in the Lenticular Lens a set-like operator
    between two sets A (set of resources) and B (set of links) that results in a subset
    of links from B where only resources from A occur as the target of each link.
